/**
 * Turn a song into a flat, time-sorted list of MIDI events.
 *
 * A gate goes high at the start of an on-step and stays high for the whole step. If the
 * following step is also on, the gate is held through it, so a run of consecutive on-steps
 * is one gate that only drops at the next off-step (or the end of the section). A divided
 * step (see `Section.divisions`) fires its share of gates back to back inside the step
 * instead, each taking an equal part of it, and never joins a run: the gates around it drop
 * before it and start fresh after it. Step starts follow the section's swing (see
 * `swingDelay` in core/timing.ts): a swung step starts late and the step before it holds on
 * until it does, so the gates stay back to back.
 *
 * On top of the drawn gates, the x16 clock on CLOCK_NOTE pulses CLOCK_PULSES_PER_BEAT times
 * per beat of every section, following each section's tempo and time signature. Mute and
 * solo never touch it, and neither does swing: like a DAW's MIDI clock it stays straight, so
 * gear following it keeps time while the gates shuffle around it.
 *
 * Pure: the same song always yields the same events.
